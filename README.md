# CenterGraph

CenterGraph is a framework to develop modern web driven applications with RDF and SHACL at its core.

It tries to abstract away RDf from the frontend developer. It does not hide it, but it gives helpful methods to easily build UI from the data.

## TODO

- Allow a React import of the SHACL renderer that does not use a customElement.
- Create an easy way of showing a loader for populating the offline dataset.
