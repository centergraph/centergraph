The plan is to make it possible to use CenterGraph with an in-memory data store that writes back to the hard disk or with a triple store that supports [SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/).

The idea is that you can start developing your application(s) with the in-memory data store and only when needed start to use a database.
