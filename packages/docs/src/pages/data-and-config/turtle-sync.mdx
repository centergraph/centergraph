Turtle Sync helps with syncing the turtle files on the hard disk to the in memory store or to your database such as Apache Jena.

To move the configuration from development to production you have to commit the files with Git. You can configure a document with the following:

```turtle
@prefix ts: <https://centergraph.danielbeeke.nl/turtle-sync#> .

<>
  ts:strategy ts:DeleteInsert ;
  ...
```

The available strategies:

## ts:Ensure

The document will be inserted once and changes on the instance of your application will be preserved.

## ts:Delete

The document will be deleted. The identifier can not be used anymore.

## ts:DeleteInsert

The document is deleted and created each time when your application starts.
