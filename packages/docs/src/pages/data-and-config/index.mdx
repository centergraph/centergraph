When developing you have multiple types of data:

- Configuration
- Metadata
- Files

## Configuration

You can have multiple projects running in one repository.

- /.env
- /data/[project]/context.json
- /data/[project]/jwks.json
- /data/[project]/\*_/_.shacl.ttl

Confguration in CenterGraph is mostly SHACL shape in turtle format.

## Metadata

Metadata comes in all kinds of shapes. It is the data of your app. For an addressbook it would be the contacts and their information.

## Files

Files can be pictures, videos, any file type. For an addressbook these could be pictures of a contact person.
