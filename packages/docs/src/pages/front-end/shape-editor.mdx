SHACL can be a daunting technology. For that reason there is a shape editor inside CenterGraph. This is a UI that guides the user in creating a SHACL shape. It only supports a subset of the functionality of SHACL.

It can edit SHACL shapes that are used for forms and the ones that are used for viewing. Inside CenterGraph one shape document often holds many shapes, one for editing and various ones for viewing.
