CenterGraph comes with an SDK package. This package is somewhat geared towards React but the core functionality is also available as thenables.

## `new CenterGraph(Options)`

```ts
import { CenterGraph } from '@centergraph/sdk'

export const api = new CenterGraph({
  base: 'http://my-centergraph-domain.com',
})
```

- base: The domain where your CenterGraph server is hosted. In development mode this should be: http://localhost:8000.

## Getting types for your data

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "wait-on http://localhost:8000 && curl http://localhost:8000/api/types > src/types.ts && vite --port=8001"
  }
}
```

It is recommended to use something similar to the above code sample. It fetches the types from the back-end and savees them in a local folder. If you are using Deno it is also possible to hot-link to the types.

All the types are in one file so it is easy to update the whole file.

The [wait-on](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wait-on) tool can help you in waiting for the back-end server to come online. This is helpful for development where you might start all the tools at once.

## `api.get<Type>(): Thenable<Type>`

Fetch a document. This method does not understand what data is flowing through it, so it is to the developer to add the type.

```ts
import { Person } from './types'

const person = api.get<Person>('/contacts/john-doe')
```

If you would like to have a resource that is possible by adding `.asResource()` to the chain.
The technical details are quite well explained here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZnXwuhYZBc.

The core idea of a Resource is that it throws a Promise instead of an Error as long as the promise is not resolved. React will resolve the promise and try again to render your component untill it does not catch a promise.

The state and cache of the promise are inside the api.

```ts
function MyComponent() {
  const person = api.get<Person>('/contacts/john-doe').asResource()
  return <h1>Hi {person.name}</h1>
}
```

## `api.getFolder(path: string): Thenable<NamedNode[]>`

Retrieves the paths as `NamedNode<string>`s from a folder.
If you would like to have a resource that is possible by adding `.asResource()` to the chain.

```ts
const folderUrls = await api.getFolder('/contacts/')

...

function MyComponent() {
  const folderUrls = api.getFolder('/contacts/').asResource()
  ...
}

```

## `<View data={api.get('/contacts/john-doe')} as="card" />`

Uses the SHACL renderer to display data according to the SHACL shape that is referenced in the `sh:shapesGraph`. The `as="card"` specifies the sub graph that is references. Inside a SHACL shape document there can be multiple graphs each for displaying the data in a different way. There also will be a main shape to use for forms.

## `<Form data={api.get('/contacts/john-doe')}/>`

Uses the SHACL renderer to display data according to the SHACL shape that is referenced in the `sh:shapesGraph`.
